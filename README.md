# Hi, I'm Hieu Le

I'm a 16-year-old full-stack web developer who enjoys building real-world applications that are fast, secure, and practical. I love turning ideas into working systems, especially when I get to focus on backend architecture and well-structured user interfaces.

## SarangXanh – Eco-Friendly Shopping Platform (Team Project)

[View Project Repository](https://github.com/kerbthecurb/SarangXanh.git)

A full-stack website built for SarangXanh, a Vietnamese non-profit environmental organization.

**My contributions:**

- **Developed the entire backend** using Node.js, Express, and MySQL
- **Implemented secure user login** with **JWT authentication** and **password hashing**
- **Built the admin dashboard** with full **CRUD features** and **role-based access control**
- Created backend routes and logic for managing **dynamic content** and **event data**
- Integrated **React data visualization libraries** to display graphs from the database
- **Designed and developed the homepage**, including responsive layout and animation — the most complex part of the frontend
- Used GitHub Desktop to coordinate **version control** and **team merges**

Although I didn’t create the repository, I contributed **over 50% of the codebase** and handled the **most technically challenging parts** of the project.
